Learning Outcomes:
• Accurate Survival Prediction: We attained a high accuracy rate, ensuring the model reliably predicts an individual's survival chances in accidents, which in turn can help many transport companies, the government and individuals to help reduce dangerous accidents.
• Attribute Importance: We uncovered the significance of specific features (ex: seatbelt usage, impact speed), providing actionable insights for safety improvements in a transport, which will help companies to make reliable and safe changes to prevent horrific accidents.
• Generalization: We learnt to establish a model capable of classifying new and unseen data, enhancing its practical usage in different accident scenarios and use such data for helping the society.
• Safety recommendations: We also learnt to enable the identification of key safety factors which will improve overall accident survival rates and give important insights in different accident scenarios.
